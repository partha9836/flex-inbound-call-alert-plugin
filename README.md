# 📞 Flex Inbound Call Alert Plugin

A custom Twilio Flex plugin that plays a sound alert for inbound voice calls. This helps agents get notified audibly when new calls arrive, reducing the risk of missed customer interactions.


## 🎯 Objective

This plugin notifies Flex agents about incoming **inbound voice calls** using a browser-based audio alert. It plays a looping sound until the agent accepts, rejects, or the reservation times out.
